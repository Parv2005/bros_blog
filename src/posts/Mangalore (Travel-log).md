# Review and Highlights

* **Food** 
	* [Hotel Narayana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/teA65DvLLW5kod3q9) (Lunch, Seafood) The best seafood I've ever had, the place was very crowded, also it's not like a traditional restaurant where you order, the food arrives one by one and If you want something you can ask for that. (5/5)
	* [Machli](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AtDdoU1rKVByZ1x56) (Lunch, Seafood) The 2nd best seafood I've ever had (4.5/5)
	* [Ideal Cream Parlour](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MLShh15imE2g2wTM8) (Desert, Snacks) **We visited this place 4 times, during our 2 day trip.** Why? I think it's a combination of things, the weather in Mangalore was too hot and humid, and this ice cream place was like an Oasis in the middle of the desert, also everything (ice cream, shakes, juices) we tried here was pretty damn good. (5/5)
	* Had a good south Indian breakfast at [Hotel Taj Mahal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qoWzKhGTjFBPPHEC8) (Kusdos for being open before 6 am) and [Hotel New Uma Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SEj25ND9g4FcoYjt9)
* **Attractions**
	* **Beaches**
		* [Batapady Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RE4Kt4Uw9nMYAzVP9) There was no one else there while we visited in the morning, it was peaceful, clean, and beautiful. Although the sand was coarse walking on it was annoying. (3/5)
		*  [Sunset Point](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y9hz4ziF6kRKnz4H7) was Very Lame, the Beach was dirty, Sunset looked good. (2/5)
	* [City Center Mall](8C8EZEJarygCvG736) is a decent mall that has a food court and cinema, The reason why we visited it twice is that **It has AC** (3.5/5)
	* [Pilikula Biological Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NGw9a5JwNTbX4qru7) Surprised by how much we enjoyed the **Science Center.** Also has a pretty good **Zoo**. (4/5) 
* **Accommodation**
	* [TentMonk Beach Stay & Resort](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MVUW76Hy7xu4K69s7) is A bit far from the main city but peaceful, the place is very small and only has 3 cottages (rooms), the rooms are decent, and the owner and caretaker seemed like nice people. (4/5)
* **Transportation**
	* **Auto**: Autos in Mangalore are fairly priced as they run on meters, sometimes if the destination is far or is night time they'll charge 1.5x but even after that prices are still fair. (5/5)
	* **Cab**: The hotel cab was expensive, couldn't get an Uber from [City Center Mall](8C8EZEJarygCvG736) during the night. (2/5)
	* **Rental Scooter**: we rented two scooters from [Planet Safari](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fiKFKthdGzLbeN8MA) One of the scooters' chains broke down. We contacted the place and they asked us to pick up a replacement scooter at a nearby place. (3.5/5)
	* **Bus**:
		* Bangalore -> Mangalore | **Orange Tours and Travels Grand** | Hygienic, Good vertical space for sitting in the sleeper.(4/5)
		* Mangalore -> Bangalore | **Sugama Tourist** | Bad service (we didn't get boarding details until 5 mins before the boarding time), faulty AC, no blankets, poor suspension, upper seats don't have enough vertical space for sitting. (1.5/5)


## What could have been done better?

* **Time of visit**, It was too hot, visit during winter, And if possible come during weekdays to possibly avoid the crowd at the restaurant.
* Sunset: A better sunset experience would be at the beach near the [Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MVUW76Hy7xu4K69s7) rather than the sunset spot.
* **Learn the name of the fish and the type of prep beforehand.** (Order Rawa Fry instead of Tawa Fry 🥲)

## Would I like to visit again?

Yes, for the seafood.
