# Piyush's blog 


[![Github Action status](https://github.com/Piyush811999/blog/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/Piyush811999/blog/actions)

Hi, welcome. This blog is a modified fork of this [blahg](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg). It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build), and currently is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## See the blog

[piyushmakwana.in](https://piyushmakwana.in/)

## Run it yourself

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                          | Action                                                        |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`                    | Installs dependencies                                         |
| `npm run dev`                    | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`                   |

## ToDo
- [ ] Dark Mode support (It's present in parent [blahg](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg), but I broke it while making modifications)
- [ ] A gallery page for all my Drawings, designs and photography stuff.
